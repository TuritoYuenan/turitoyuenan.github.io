It's not really a techinique or anything. I was watching a Vsauce video and he made a statement that shows the perspective of time, of history that I find cool. So I would like to share how you can make a similar statement.

Firstly, we will take a distant event in history (Event X). Then calculate how long it is to nowadays. Now, find the middle point - the point of time that is halfway from that event to now. From that we can look on what was happening in that middle point (Event Y), and make the statement that it takes around the same amount of time from Event X to Event Y, as it does from Event Y to nowadays.

For an example, since I'm Vietnamese, let's take the Trưng sisters Rebellion which happened in year 40. From the rebellion to nowadays is around two thousand years or less. So halfway of that time will be 1000 years, from year 40 to around year 1000. Looking through the history book and it shows that the Ly dynasty moved their capital to Thăng Long (now Hà Nội) in 1010, which is close enough.

From that we can say, that it took roughly the same time from Trưng sisters Rebellion to the first moving of Vietnam's capital, as from the first capital moving to current day, in 2023.

By the way, in Vsauce's video his statement was that "the Pyramids of Giza were as old to the ancient Romans, as the ancient Romans are to us"
